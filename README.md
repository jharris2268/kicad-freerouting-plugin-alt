# kicad-freerouting-plugin-alt
An alternative **[freerouting](https://github.com/freerouting/freerouting)** plugin for kicad, 
using a modifed **[command line verion of freerouting](http://repo.hu/projects/freerouting_cli/)**.

This allows freerouting to run without opening a seperate application window. Instead, the kicad pcb
editor is updated with the new traces as freerouting runs.
