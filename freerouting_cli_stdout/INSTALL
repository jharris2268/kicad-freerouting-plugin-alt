Note: this document describes how to build from source. If you do not want
to install half a gigabyte of java environemnt, you can download the
precompiled binary pack instead.

Native build
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. install dependencies

	apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk-headless openjdk-11-jre-headless zip

	Probably any version would do; it definitely works with 11. For
	producing the stand-alone package at least 14 is needed (tested
	with 16).

2. compile

	make

3.a. install the jre pack

	Run as root:

	make install

	Resulting files are copied in /opt/freerouting_cli/

	This setup assumes the system has JRE installed. If you are running this
	on the same system you compiled on, this is true. If you plan to distrubute
	the result as a tarball, the tarball will also assume JRE installed on
	the target systems.

3.b. creating a binary pack

	make binpack

	make tarball

	make zip

	These commands will create build/freerouting_cli/,
	build/freerouting_cli.tar.gz and build/freerouting_cli.zip
	respectively. Installation procedure of the tarball/zip pack: unpack
	in /opt on the target system.

3.c. deb and rpm

	make deb

	make rpm

	Will create build/freerouting*.deb or build/freerouting*.rpm, if jpackage
	supports those targets. These packages will contain the same
	/opt/freerouting_cli as the other ones in 3.a. or 3.b.
